# Initialize installation

I just found the source code of a game I wrote like 1000000 years ago. Now to prevent me from deleting it (again) and to make it easier to install on my school's computer, I am uploading it to github.

The installation include 2 zip files and 1 folder:
- CompileInitialize.zip: This zip contain all the files needed to compile this game (SDL1.2 and C++)
- Initialize_TheMultiverseSerie..zip (it was supposed to be Initialize_TheMultiverseSeries.zip): Contain only the source code and resource like map, font and images.
- The folder: Contain the exe, download this folder and double click on the exe to launch the game.

I abandoned this game to fix the story (and also the code is also crap, read it and you will know, Im also have no idea how I created this game 1000000 years ago).

This game can be used for educational purpose to teach childrens how to make a crappy games.

This was originally made to compile on C4Droid on Android because I am poor and dont have a computer (actually I refused to use my parent's money, so I am basically richer than you students).

The story is now changed and I have lost my interest in games so dont think of asking me to continue this game project (but if you want to continue my project feel free to ask).

No copyright on this project, use it however you want (You might get copyrighted from Valve tho since I copied their game).

Have fun playing (The first map is not even done yet.. so bad I only found the early version of the game.. I swear the after versions have some really cool feature like dashing and stuff).

Anyway, have fun playing!
